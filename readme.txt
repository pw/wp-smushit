Reduce image file sizes and improve performance using the <a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> API within WordPress.

== Description ==

Yahoo's excellent <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">Exceptional Performance series</a> recommends <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#opt_images">optimizing images</a> in several lossless ways:

* stripping meta data from JPEGs
* optimizing JPEG compression
* converting certain GIFs to indexed PNGs
* stripping the un-used colours from indexed images

<a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> offers an API that performs these optimizations (except for stripping JPEG meta data) automatically, and this plugin seamlessly integrates Smush.it with WordPress.

= How does it work? =
Every image you add to a page or post will be automatically run through Smush.it behind the scenes.  You don&rsquo;t have to do anything different.

= Existing images =
You can also run your existing images through Smush.it via the WordPress `Media Library`.  Click on the `Smush.it now!` link for any image you'd like to smush.

= Privacy = 
Be sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with Smush.it&rsquo;s privacy policy (found on their <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/smush_it/smush_it-4378.html">FAQ</a>).

= Updates, etc... =
